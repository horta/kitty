Shell integration
======================

kitty has the ability to integrate closely within common shells, such as `zsh
<https://www.zsh.org/>`_, `fish <https://fishshell.com>`_ and `bash
<https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/>`_ to enable features such as jumping to
previous prompts in the scrollback, viewing the output of the last command in
:program:`less`, using the mouse to move the cursor while editing prompts, etc.
